Welcome to Money Diaries, where we're tackling what might be the last taboo facing modern working women: money. We're asking millennials how they spend their hard-earned money during a seven-day period â€” and we're tracking every last dollar.This week, we're looking at moms and their spending during the back-to-school rush. Per Deloitte, in the United States alone, back-to-school season is the second biggest shopping season of the year, "touching 29 million households and accounting for $27 billion in sales." Since women are usually responsible for household purchases, wherever they are in the country or in the world, we want to see what it's like for women with children of a variety of ages, in a variety of locations.First up this week: a human resources manager who makes $48,222 per year, and spends some of it this week on loaves of rye bread and prescription drugs.Editor's Note: All prices have been converted to the U.S. dollar using conversion figures at the time her diary was submitted.
