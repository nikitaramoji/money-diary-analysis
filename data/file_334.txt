Welcome to Money Diaries, where we're tackling what might be the last taboo facing modern working women: money. We're asking millennials how they spend their hard-earned money during a seven-day period â€” and we're tracking every last dollar.This week a case manager and graduate student who makes $50,000 per year and spends it on black Aerie underwear.Occupations: Case Manager (Full-Time), Crisis Hotline Specialist (Part-Time), Graduate Student (Part-Time)Industry: NonprofitAge: 27Location: Arlington, VASalary: $50,000 + $18/hrPaycheck Amount (2x/month): $1,688-$1,788 ($1,288 + $400-$500)Monthly ExpensesHousing: $975.

I pay all of this because I used to work from home a lot, and I needed reliable internet for work, and cable for entertainment.Transportation: ~$40.
