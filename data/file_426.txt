Welcome to Money Diaries, where we're tackling what might be the last taboo facing modern working women: money. We asked a millennial woman how she spends her hard-earned money during a seven-day period — and we're tracking every last dollar. (Thanks, New York mag, for the inspiration.) 

Today, we are featuring a Canadian-Chinese woman living in Singapore.Industry: Finance  Location: Singapore  Salary: $117,850 (based on current exchange rate of USD/SGD: 1.4)  Age: 29 Roommates: 1 (husband and dog) Monthly ExpensesRent: $1,780 (split 50/50 with my husband) Utilities: $300 (50% water and electricity, 50% mobile bills)Day One 9 a.m. — It's Sunday, so I head to a barre class. I pre-paid for a package of 10 classes for $215. Stop by 7-Eleven to grab a bottle of Fiji water. $2 11 a.m. — The barre class is held near one of the only two açai-bowl places in Singapore, so I go there for food. The shop is located in the basement of a shopping mall, and on the way over I get distracted by Ladurée. I buy three macarons. Then, I get the Nut Bowl from Project Açaí with peanut butter, banana, and chia seeds. $15.11 11:50 a.m. — I arrive at a Starbucks to meet a potential interior designer for our condo. I get an iced tall Americano. $3.072:30 p.m. — The meeting runs for two hours, and both my husband and I are starving. We go for Chinese hotpot and pig out. The bill comes out to $78.57, but the husband pays for it. We keep our finances separate for now, so we alternate paying for big meals and rent is split. If we have a child, we will probably open a joint account.

4:30 p.m. — Even though we are stuffed to the brim, we still get organic soft-serve to take home ($8.43). Husband pays for it.

Day Two 8:30 a.m. — I take an Uber to work each morning. Owning a car is exorbitantly expensive in Singapore, so we take Uber everywhere. $8.469 a.m. — I pick up my usual iced skinny mocha for the morning. $5.3612:30 p.m. — Lunch with a friend. I get a soup-and-sandwich set. Our lunch expense is reimbursed by my company, capped at $15.

Day Three  8:30 a.m. — Uber. Why the fare varies every day I will never understand. $14.14 9 a.m. — I'm starving, so I get my usual iced skinny mocha and a chocolate croissant. There is a morning combo special today. $5.36 12:15 p.m. — I am at the airport waiting to board a flight to Hong Kong for work. I don’t particularly enjoy food served in economy class, so I get a bowl of beef noodles prior to boarding. I also grab two gossip magazines to catch up with all the Kardashians. $22.146:30 p.m. — In Hong Kong, I meet up with a friend who is flying to Paris that night. She treats me to a detox juice.

The bill for the eight of us comes to about $260, split evenly. $32.13 Total: $353.46
