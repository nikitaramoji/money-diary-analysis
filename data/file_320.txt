Welcome to Money Diaries, where we're tackling what might be the last taboo facing modern working women: money. We're asking millennials how they spend their hard-earned money during a seven-day period â€” and we're tracking every last dollar.This week: a librarian who makes $49,992 per year and spends some of it on seaweed chips.Occupation: Accessioning & Collections Manager, a.k.a. LibrarianIndustry: Academic Libraries/Special Collections LibrariesAge: 28Location: Atlanta, GASalary: $49,992.229. My husband's is $56,800.Paycheck (1x month): $2,900; my husband's is $3,400. My husband is also a librarian. He has been there longer and is in a slightly different rank than me, so he makes more. We don't separate expenses at all. Our paychecks all go into one account that we use to pay for everything. I manage our finances and pay all of our bills out of the one shared account that we have. If we go out, whether together or separately, we spend from that same account. We have a shared spreadsheet to manage our budget.Monthly ExpensesHousing: $1,515. My husband and I rent a two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment with hardwood floors in a complex that has a lot of amenities and is about three miles from where we work. Our rent is higher than average for Atlanta because of the neighborhood in which we live and our proximity to an elite university.Loan PaymentsStudent Loans: $300 My Husband's Student Loans: $600Car Loan (Joint): $268.72All Other Monthly ExpensesWater & Sewer: ~$30Trash & Pest: $24Car & Renter's Insurance: $121.73Cell Phone: $162.55Gym Membership: $155 for dance studio membershipHealth Insurance: $99.18 for medical, dental and vision (pre-tax)FSA Contribution: $125 pre-taxOn-Campus Parking: $28Retirement Contributions: $83.32 pre-tax (403(b)) and $83.32 post-tax (Roth) with employer match comes to $540.Internet: $64.99, which includes HBONowHulu: $7.99Netflix: $9.99Gas & Electric: $80Washer/Dryer Rental: $35.88Credit Card: $1,200 (on a balance of $11,000)Gift To My Mom: $100.
