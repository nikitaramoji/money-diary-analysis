Welcome to Money Diaries, where we're tackling what might be the last taboo facing modern working women: money. Each week, we ask a millennial woman how she spends her hard-earned money during a seven-day period — and we're tracking every last cent. (Thanks New York Mag for the inspiration.) 
The first step to getting your financial life in order is tracking what you spend — to try on your own, check out our guide to managing your money every day.
This week, a New York City product manager planning for a trip abroad and eating Greek yogurt every day.Industry: MediaLocation: New York CitySalary: $120,000Age: 27Roommates: 1

Monthly Expenses:Mortgage: $952.23Monthly Maintenance: $718.42Internet: $40Utilities: $54Day One5 a.m. — I spend my morning running errands. I pick up a passport for an upcoming trip and stop by Whole Foods for some quick “healthy” breakfast ingredients — Greek yogurt and green juice. $5.49

Noon — Forgot to bring leftovers from dinner last night for lunch, so I have to resort to our super-expensive food court at work. Does a Dos Toros salad count as healthy? $10.75

6 p.m. — Rush home to move my bed out of my apartment. The boyfriend is taking it to put in the guest room at his place. Since I’m running late (yay, work issues before the weekend), I hop in a cab. $26.15.

8 p.m. — Dinner is homemade! And since we're at the boyfriend’s house, he buys the groceries. We make whole wheat pasta in a garlic white wine sauce with hot Italian sausage, spinach, and kale. $0

I have one hard-boiled egg and a small cup of oatmeal with blueberries and cinnamon. $09:30 a.m. — My new bed frame and mattress are finally delivered! And thanks to white glove delivery, they also assemble it. Tip the guys $20 each. $40

Noon — I stop by my local Japanese store to pick up a quick snack. No big meal today, because we have a farewell dinner party tonight, so I grab some onigiri for myself and two friends, plus some iced tea. $9.544 p.m. — Bloomingdale's sales are my weakness. I pick up the softest cashmere turtleneck sweater on sale from All Saints. We’ll see if I end up returning it. $201.60 

5:30 p.m. — Pre-dinner drinks for three in Union Square as we wait for the crew to show up for dinner. I end up not paying for dinner, because the boyfriend insists on treating. $318 p.m. — Fiasco with the kitchen renovation! The sink I ordered is too big (double basin sinks require 36” cabinets at a minimum, apparently). So I return the current sink (I’m refunded $353.21.) and order another sink that actually fits in our space ($463.33). $110.12Total: $392.26Day Three9 a.m. — I eat breakfast at home.

Noon — Ran downstairs for a noodle bowl and ate at my desk. $12.806:00 p.m. — I’m going to a wedding in Thailand and I have nothing to wear.
