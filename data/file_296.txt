Welcome to Money Diaries, where we're tackling what might be the last taboo facing modern working women: money. We're asking millennials how they spend their hard-earned money during a seven-day period — and we're tracking every last dollar.Today: a locomotive driver who makes $103,500 per year. She spends some of her money this week on a steak sandwich.Editor's Note: All prices have been converted to the U.S. dollar using conversion figures at the time her diary was submitted.

Paycheck (Every Two Weeks): $3,980.76 pre-taxMonthly ExpensesHousing: My husband and I are paying off a "Queenslander" style home. It is a high-set house and approximately 60 years old — that means lots of renovations and maintenance. Our mortgage repayments are $793 every two weeks, which comes out of our joint account. (My husband earns roughly $96,000 pre-tax per year.)Rental: I also pay $175 every two weeks for a rental closer to my workplace. I work a 7/4 roster, meaning I spend seven days away from home, and then have four days off. During my seven days at work, I have a somewhat "indicative" pattern, meaning my shift start times should slowly wind back later every day. (For example: Shift 1 would be a 6 a.m. start; shift 2 is a 10 a.m. start, etc. It rarely works like this, however.) My shift lengths are up to 12 hours. Our home is on a quarter-acre block and has views of the ocean and Great Barrier Reef. It is idyllic, with palm trees and tropical flora and fauna.Loan Payments: $118 every two weeks for a Honda Quadbike/ATV vehicle.All Other Monthly ExpensesCar Payments: $396 every two weeks for novated leasesElectricity: $793/month over two homes.
