Welcome to Money Diaries, where we're tackling what might be the last taboo facing modern working women: money. We're asking millennials how they spend their hard-earned money during a seven-day period — and we're tracking every last dollar.Last month, we looked at several Money Diaries from moms leading up to the beginning of the back-to-school season: One mother had older children who were increasingly independent; another mom was a graduate student on active duty in the military; and another diary featured a stay-at-home mom with twins starting preschool.This week, we're taking another look at scholastic Money Diaries — from college and graduate students. Today: an MBA candidate and bridal stylist who makes $15,300 per year. She spends some of her money this week on a Nutella muffin and a new, single-speed cruiser bike.Editor's Note: All prices have been converted to the U.S. dollar.Occupation: MBA Candidate & Bridal Stylist Industry: Bridal Age: 24Location: Melbourne, AustraliaSalary: $15,300Paycheck (2x/month): $820Monthly ExpensesHousing Costs: $715.
