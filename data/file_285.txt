Welcome to Money Diaries, where we're tackling what might be the last taboo facing modern working women: money. We're asking millennials how they spend their hard-earned money during a seven-day period — and we're tracking every last dollar.Last month, we looked at several Money Diaries from moms leading up to the beginning of the back-to-school season. One mother had older children who were increasingly independent, another mom was a graduate student on active duty in the military, and another diary featured a stay-at-home mom with twins starting preschool.This week, we're taking another look at scholastic Money Diaries — this time from college and graduate students. First up: a planning assistant and student who makes $26,300 per year. She spends some of her paycheck this week on natural deodorant.Occupation: Student, Planning Assistant (Full-Time), and Contract NaturalistIndustry: Parks & Outdoor Education Age: 26Location: Los Angeles, CASalary: $26,300 before taxesPaycheck (Biweekly): $821.33 after taxes, plus a minimum of $100/month for contract work.Monthly ExpensesHousing: $400.
