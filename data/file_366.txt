Welcome to Money Diaries, where we're tackling what might be the last taboo facing modern working women: money. We're asking millennial women how they spend their hard-earned money during a seven-day period — and we're tracking every last dollar. (Thanks, New York mag, for the inspiration.)

10:15 a.m. — I eat some office oatmeal and have a leftover iced coffee in the fridge from yesterday for breakfast. Usually I spend way too much money on food and coffee, so this week I am trying to be creative with free food!

3:30 p.m. — Order new probiotics and a health and nutrition book on Amazon. $52.36

5:30 p.m. — I go for a manicure every two weeks and a pedicure once a month. Since I go to the same salon, I have a loyalty card where you save $10 when you spend $100. I get a manicure and add a 10-minute massage today, and it ended up only being $17 because I receive my $10 off today! I tip my technician $10. (All about giving good tips.) $27.00

I wandered into Sephora and came out with an RMS Beauty Oil — something I've been lusting after for so long.
