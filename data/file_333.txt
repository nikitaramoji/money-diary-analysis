Welcome to Money Diaries, where we're tackling what might be the last taboo facing modern working women: money. We're asking millennials how they spend their hard-earned money during a seven-day period — and we're tracking every last dollar.This week: a marketing manager who makes $68,000 per year and spends it on very large croissants.Occupation: Marketing ManagerIndustry: Financial ServicesAge: 28Location: Los Angeles, CASalary: $68,000/year (mine) + $118,000 (partner's)Paycheck (2x/month): $1,866 after taxes and deductionsMonthly ExpensesHousing: $2,200/month to rent a dated two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment with no laundry and one parking spot in a nice neighborhood. My husband handles all of the expenses related to the apartment, including rent and utilities. We used to own a small condo, but we sold it two years ago at a nice profit with the idea of upgrading to a house. We are still living in the "temporary" apartment with no end in sight, since the housing market here is crazy and you get very little for a lot of money. We're planning on settling in, and waiting for a housing crash  —  which is an absolutely awful thing to wish for, but seems to be the only way we will get our foot in the door. Loan Payments: $750/month for two new cars plus $120 for husband's student loans. He handles all three expenses.All Other Monthly Expenses: My husband and I maintain separate finances. To make up for the discrepancy between our salaries, we loosely divide up what we pay for. My spending typically includes the following each month:Daughter's College Fund: $400 (My husband also contributes)Savings: $500 (at minimum)Pre-School: $479, which covers two mornings per week. (Our extended family very generously provides childcare for free.)401(k): $418, deducted from my paycheck.Roth IRA: $250 Orthodontist: $250 for my monthly Invisalign payment.Gym Membership: $82HBO: $14.99 (for the add-on subscription to our Amazon Prime account)Netflix: $9.99Microsoft Office: $6.99 subscription on our shared family laptopCharitable Giving: $15 recurring gifts to Planned Parenthood and EMILY's List
