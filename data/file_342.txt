Welcome to Money Diaries, where we're tackling what might be the last taboo facing modern working women: money. We're asking millennials how they spend their hard-earned money during a seven-day period — and we're tracking every last dollar.This week: a multicultural marketing account executive who makes $50,000 a year and spends it on Swedish pancakes.Occupation: Multicultural Marketing Account ExecutiveIndustry: MarketingAge: 27Location: Seattle, WASalary: $50,000Paycheck (2x/month): $1,652Monthly ExpensesHousing: $970. My boyfriend and I live together in a condo that I own. He pays me $700/month in rent, and I pay the remainder of the monthly payment, which includes the principle, interest, taxes, and HOA dues.Loan Payments: $0 (aside from mortgage)HSA: I contribute $44/month, and my employer contributes $44/month.Public Transportation: My company provides me with a free unlimited bus pass.Car Insurance: $60/month. I take public transportation as much as I can, and for work travel I tend to take one of our two company cars. I am also a fan of UberPool when I'm meeting friends around town — to avoid drinking and driving, and since parking can be tough. I don't end up driving much on a regular basis, and I fill up my tank at most twice a month. Filling up is around $25.All Other Monthly ExpensesGroceries/Utilities/Household: $300. Every month, my boyfriend and I each transfer $300 into our joint checking account. We use this money to pay for groceries, utilities, and household items.Pets: $300 for a dog sitter that checks in on and walks our four-month-old puppy once a day; we split this evenly. (So my share is $150.) We also have two cats, and we pay for pet food and other supplies using our joint account (~$80/month). My boyfriend has paid all the dog's vet bills so far, and I've paid for all the cat bills earlier this year. The cats' yearly check-ups and vaccines came to around $300 total.Gym membership: $82 charged to my credit card. This covers both my boyfriend and me.Savings: $450 from each paycheck, though if other expenses come up, I don't always meet this goal.Health and Dental Insurance: $0. Work fully covers this for me.Cell Phone: $30/month. My plan has unlimited texting and data, but only 100 talking minutes per month, so sometimes I end up buying another $10 in prepaid minutes. I make the majority of my work calls from my office phone, and I speak to my parents and siblings in Panama through WhatsApp, an app that allows you to make voice calls through Wi-Fi/data.Internet: $50/monthNetflix: $10/month. I also use my boyfriend's family's HBO GO account.
