Welcome to Money Diaries, where we're tackling what might be the last taboo facing modern working women: money. We're asking millennials how they spend their hard-earned money during a seven-day period — and we're tracking every last dollar.This week, we’re taking a look at the way interns are spending across the country. Internships can be a key way of getting experience, gaining entry into fields, and making connections, but not everyone has the ability — in terms of timing or finances — to make it happen. For those who do, managing an internship during the traditional work and school year, or working full-or-part-time over the summer can provide an exciting (or nerve-wracking!) preview of life after college.Today: a tech intern who makes $600-$1,000 a month and spends some of it on laundry and birth control.Occupation: Part-Time InternIndustry: Tech StartupAge: 21Location: Pittsburgh, PAPaycheck (2x/month): $300 - $500Monthly ExpensesHousing: $535 to share a three-bedroom apartment off-campus with three roommates.
