Welcome to Money Diaries, where we're tackling what might be the last taboo facing modern working women: money. We asked a millennial woman how she spends her hard-earned money during a seven-day period — and we're tracking every last cent. (Thanks, New York Mag, for the inspiration.)

They make me drink some Sprite before I go because my blood sugar is low. We'll find out in a few weeks how much the coinsurance is for the x-ray and fluids, but the co-pay for the visit is $50.8 p.m. — My boyfriend brings me an almond chai tea latte and then my friend takes us all back to my place. My boyfriend's car is still in the shop so he takes my car to pick up more Gatorade and tissues. He also gets me a taco and some potato oles from Taco John's and a glazed donut at Dunkin' Donuts per my request.
