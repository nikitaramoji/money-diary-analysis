Welcome to Money Diaries, where we're tackling what might be the last taboo facing modern working women: money. We're asking millennials how they spend their hard-earned money during a seven-day period — and we're tracking every last dollar.This week, we're featuring moms and their spending during the back-to-school rush. Per Deloitte, in the United States alone, back-to-school season is the second biggest shopping season of the year, "touching 29 million households and accounting for $27 billion in sales." Since women are usually responsible for household purchases, wherever they are in the country or in the world, we wanted to see what it's like for women with children of a variety of ages, in a variety of locations.Today: a homemaker who makes $45,000 per year.

We each have some savings accounts in our individual names, but our money is effectively joined in every regard.Paycheck (Once Per Month): $3,750, plus about $500/month for side freelance work and my Etsy shopMonthly ExpensesHousing: $1,400 rental homeLoan Payments: $0.
